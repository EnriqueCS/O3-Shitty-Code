# Out-of-order Execution

I'm bored and didn’t pay attention in class, so I’m going to try tackling it on my own.

I'll document everything in a structured, step-by-step format, similar to a "Let's Play" tutorial, making it easy to follow along and learn from my process.

Intel **Quartus Prime** is software for designing and programming **Intel FPGAs** using Verilog or VHDL. 
It helps turn your code into a working circuit, test it, and load it onto the FPGA.

We are choosing the RISC-V instruction set because it is open-source, well-documented, and widely supported, making it an ideal choice for our out-of-order processor implementation.
